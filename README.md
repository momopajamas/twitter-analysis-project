# Business Understanding
Microsoft wants to be able to factor in sentiments about our products and services expressed on social media platforms like Twitter to supplement the feedback we received through official review channels like Amazon, Yelp, etc. 

Specifically, Microsoft wants to look at Positive feedback produced organically on social media about our products and services to know what we should develop further, expand upon, and keep from undermining through budget cuts and the like. We want to be able to filter tweets carrying Positive sentiments so that we are able to assess what's working well.

The way we will go about this is by creating a **binary classification model** that is trained and tested on a dataset containing tweets where users expressed various emotions or reactions to other products, as the essential issue is how well our model is able to parse through and differentiate between Positive tweets on the one hand, and Negative or Neutral tweets on the other hand.

In evaluating out work, we need to ascertain how effective we were at correctly identifying Positive tweets, keeping an eye out for **False Positives** in particular as non-Positive sentiments seeping into our Positive class would muddy our analysis and cause problems down the road.

False Negatives are important to keep an eye out for as well, however not as important as False Positives. While missing out on Positive sentiments that fell through the cracks is not ideal, it is more detrimental for our purposes for our Positive category to carry Negative or Neutral sentiments.
